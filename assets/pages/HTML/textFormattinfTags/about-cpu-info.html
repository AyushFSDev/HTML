    <h1>CPU Information</h1>
    <h3>Definition of CPU</h3>
    <p>
      A CPU is a computer's central processing unit. It is a circuit board that
      performs the basic functions of a computer, such as arithmetic, logic, and
      input/output (I/O). The CPU is the heart of a computer. It is responsible
      for the processing of instructions and data, and for the execution of
      programs.

    <h2>CPU Components</h2>
    <p>1. Primary memory</p>
    <p>2. Secondary memory</p>
    <p>3. Processor</p>
    <p>5. Motherboard</p>
    <p>6. Power supply</p>
    <p>7. Cooling system</p>
    <p>8. GPU (graphics processing unit)</p>

    <h2>What is Primary Memory?</h2>
    <p>
      Primary memory is the memory that stores the data that is being processed
      by the CPU. It is also known as the "working memory". <br />
      Primary memory, also known as main memory or RAM (Random Access Memory).
    </p>

    <h2>What is Secondary Memory?</h2>
    <p>
      Secondary memory is the memory that stores the instructions that the CPU
      executes. It is also known as the "program memory". <br />
      Secondary memory, also known as secondary memory or ROM (Read Only
      Memory).
    </p>

    <h2>What is Processor?</h2>
    <p>
      The processor is the brain of the computer. It is responsible for
      performing the basic functions of a computer, such as arithmetic, logic,
      and input/output (I/O). The processor is the heart of a computer. It is
      responsible for the processing of instructions and data, and for the
      execution of programs.
